## Installation

```bash
  yarn install
```

## Try it out

To try one of these examples, just go to the directory `index` and replace the first Argument of the `render` function with the component that you want to try.

```javascript
ReactDOM.render(<MemoHook />, document.getElementById('root'));
```
